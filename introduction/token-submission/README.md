# Token Submission

### Extend your dApp to IoTeX

Any dApp developer that has deployed a token on any of the blockchains supported by ioTube can [submit their token](https://github.com/iotubeproject/ioTube/issues/new?assignees=guo\&labels=Token-Pending-Review\&template=iotube-new-token-submission.md\&title=New+Token+submission) to be added to the bridge. Together with IoTeX's full [Web3 compatibility](broken-reference), you can now extend your dApp to IoTeX in no time, gaining access to trusted [verifiable IoT data](broken-reference), and run transaction-intensive tasks thanks to the IoTeX **ultra-fast** and low-fees transactions**.**

ðŸ‘‰ [**Submit your token to ioTube**](https://github.com/iotexproject/ioTube/issues/new?assignees=guo\&labels=Token-Pending-Review\&template=iotube-new-token-submission.md\&title=New+Token+submission)

### **Supported chains**

You can currently use ioTube to bridge tokens from the following blockchains to IoTeX:

* Ethereum
* Binance Smart Chain
* Polygon
* Solana&#x20;

### Guidelines for tokens

We will only take into consideration projects that:

* Do NOT represent any type of cryptocurrency "scam" e.g. project counterfeit and others.
* Show clear signs of activity: Either traffic on the network, activity on GitHub, or community buzz.

In addition:

* The token icon should be small, square, but high resolution, ideally a vector/svg.
* Make sure your website includes a detailed explanation of project and the token contract address.
* No profanity in token name, token description, etc.
* Token contract has to be verified on explorers.
* The submitter has to be verified author from the token's project.

### Verification of the token

Please provide the verification of your token in one of the following ways:

1. Token address on your website. Please specify the link.
2. CMC / Coingecko profile link with token contract address and link to website/social.

### Integration Fee

There is a one-time fee to cover the smart contract deployment and testing. The current fee structure is&#x20;

| Blockchains       | Integration Fee |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| From/To BSC       | 0.1 BNB         |
| From/To Matic     | 20 MATIC        |
| From/To Ethereum  | 0.3 ETH         |

If your request involves multiple blockchains, you may add them up as the integration fee.

Please make the fee payment to `0x571e603e3B5c82Bd40998C538603dF4fb42bB051` or `io12u0xq03mtjpt6sye33fcvq7lf76zhvz3yvt8q0` and include the payment txn link in the token submission.

### Send test tokens

Please send a few test tokens ($1-$10 worth) to wallet: `0x571e603e3B5c82Bd40998C538603dF4fb42bB051 / io12u0xq03mtjpt6sye33fcvq7lf76zhvz3yvt8q0`

NOTE: While we'll help coordinating listing your token on the [Mimo DEX](https://mimo.exchange/), you'll be responsible for listing your token on various DEXs on the other chains.&#x20;
