# Join the Bridge consensus

ioTube design allows for a fully **decentralized architecture**, with multiple off-chain "witness" and "relayer" nodes that monitor and trigger a set of on-chain contracts in a fully decentralized fashion.&#x20;

Please reach out to us if you want to join as a witness. Minimal requirement is that you need to be an IoTeX consensus delegates for three months.

Check out the [Github Repository](https://github.com/iotubeproject/ioTube#deployment) for more information on the ioTube architecture.&#x20;
