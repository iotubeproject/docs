# Join the Bridge consensus

ioTube design allows for a fully **decentralized architecture**, with multiple off-chain "witness" and "relayer" nodes that monitor and trigger a set of on-chain contracts in a fully decentralized fashion.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
**ioTube is currently in beta**, therefore joining the bridge consensus network is not publicly open yet: stay tuned to our official update channels below to get notified on when you will be able to join!
