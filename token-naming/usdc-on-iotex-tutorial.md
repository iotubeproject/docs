# USDC on IoTeX Tutorial

## Introduction to USDC Bridging on IoTeX

With ioTube v7, bridging USDC from Ethereum to IoTeX has become simpler and more efficient. The new update introduces USDC.e, replacing ioUSDC as the bridged token for USDC on IoTeX, aligning with Circle’s Bridged USDC Standard. This upgrade provides seamless compatibility and prepares IoTeX for future integrations with Circle’s native USDC issuance, enhancing security and user experience.

### 3. Receive `USDC.e` Directly on IoTeX

After the transactions are confirmed, your bridged `USDC` will be available as `USDC.e` directly on the IoTeX network. No additional conversion steps are required, thanks to ioTube v7’s auto-conversion.

## Bridging `USDC.e` from IoTeX to Another Network

### 1. Connect your Wallet

Open [iotube.org](https://iotube.org) and connect your wallet. Select the **Withdraw from IoTeX** tab:

### 3. Initiate the Withdrawal
